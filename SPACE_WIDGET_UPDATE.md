# Space Widget Click Handler Update

## Summary

Updated the space widget click handling in `event_loop.c` to use the new unified `window_manager_show_window()` function instead of the previous multi-step approach.

## Changes Made

### Before (event_loop.c)

The previous implementation used multiple steps to show a clicked window:

1. Check if window is minimized and call `window_manager_deminimize_window()`
2. Call `scripting_addition_order_window()` to show the window
3. Call `window_manager_focus_window_with_raise()` to focus and raise
4. Handle application hiding separately

### After (event_loop.c)

The updated implementation uses a single unified function:

1. Call `window_manager_show_window()` which handles all the complexity internally
2. Simple boolean return value for success/failure
3. Cleaner, more maintainable code

## Benefits

- **Simplified Logic**: Single function call instead of multiple conditional steps
- **Consistency**: Uses the same logic as the command-line visibility toggle
- **Better Maintenance**: Changes to window showing behavior only need to be made in one place
- **Reduced Code**: Fewer lines and less complexity in the event handler

## Integration

- The space widget functionality remains unchanged from a user perspective
- Clicking on window icons in the space widget will now use the same unified window showing logic as the CLI commands
- Better error handling and logging with simple success/failure reporting

## Files Modified

- `/Users/jpatrolla/Playground/yabai/src/event_loop.c` - Updated click handler to use `window_manager_show_window()`

## Compilation Status

âœ… Successfully compiles without errors (only unrelated warnings remain)
